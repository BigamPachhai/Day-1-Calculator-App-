#  CLI Calculator - How It Works

This command-line calculator uses functions for each arithmetic operation and takes user input in a loop until the user chooses to exit.

###  Flow:
1. The program displays a menu of operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, or `exit`.
2. The user selects an operation.
3. If the choice is not 'exit', the user enters two numbers.
4. Based on the selected operation:
   - A corresponding function (add, subtract, multiply, divide) is called.
   - The result is printed.
5. The program repeats until the user enters `'exit'`.

Includes input validation and checks for division by zero.
